> A curated list of awesome stateless web applications that store user-generated content directly in the URL

## What are Stateless Web Applications?

Stateless web applications encode their entire state or user-generated content directly in the URL instead of storing it in a database. This approach enables instant sharing, eliminates the need for user accounts, and makes the applications completely self-contained.

These applications are also known by various names:
- **URL-encoded state apps** - Applications that serialize their state directly into the URL
- **Share-by-URL apps** - Tools where you can share content just by sending the link
- **Database-less apps** - Applications that don't persist data server-side
- **Self-contained apps** - Applications where the URL itself contains all the data

The pattern is commonly used in text editors, JSON visualizers, regex testers, drawing tools, and other utilities where users want to quickly share their work without creating accounts or saving files.
