- **Description**: Provide a clear, concise description of what the application does
- **URL encoding**: Verify that the application actually encodes data in the URL (query parameters, hash fragments, or path)
- **No duplicates**: Search previous suggestions before making a new one
- **Proper formatting**: Follow the existing format and style
- **Alphabetical order**: Keep items in each category sorted alphabetically by name
